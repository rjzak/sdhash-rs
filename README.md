## sdhash-rs

This is an attempt at a Rust re-implementation of Vassil Roussev's and Candice Quates' sdhash ([doc](http://roussev.net/sdhash/sdhash.html), [code](https://github.com/sdhash/sdhash)) algorithm. The initial goal is to have sdhash available as a module for other applications.

Status: incomplete, work-in-progress.
